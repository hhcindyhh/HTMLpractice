    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a bedding area for your Siberian husky. He should have his own bed, a water dish and a food bowl. If you choose to keep your husky in a crate overnight, place a bed inside the crate.</li>
        <li>ntroduce your husky to his bedding area when you bring him home. If he is overwhelmed with the new surroundings, place him in the crate for a few hours, then open the door and let him wander out when he feels comfortable.</li>
        <li>Provide your dog with plenty of dog toys to keep him from chewing on other objects. If you spot your husky chewing on something you don't want him to have, take it away, say "No!" and replace the item with one of your dog's toys so he learns what he is and is not allowed to play with.</li>
